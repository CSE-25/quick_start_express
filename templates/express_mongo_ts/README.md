## Express Mongo TypeScript Starter Kit

### Get Started
1. Install required dependencies
```js
npm install && npm run dev
```
2. Create copy of `.env.example` file and name it `.env`:
```js
cp .env.example .env
```
3. Configure the environment variables in the `.env` file according to your 
project requirements. This file stores sensitive information like database 
credentials and API keys. Make sure to keep it safe and not commit it.

4. Start development server
```js
npm run dev
```

Your Express server should be up and running!
